# OVERVIW OF PROJECT:
The program is a basic calculator that prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). Based on the operator, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and displays the result.

# User Input:
The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).
Then, it asks the user to choose an operator (+, -, *, /).

# Arithmetic Operations:
The program checks which operator the user has selected and performs the appropriate arithmetic operation:
* Addition (+): Adds the two numbers.
* Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
* Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers.
* Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to ensure that division by zero does not occur.
  
  # Error Handling:
Invalid Operator: If the user inputs an operator that is not one of the specified options, the program returns an "Invalid operator!" message.
Division by Zero: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program returns an "Error! Division by zero." message to prevent a runtime error.
